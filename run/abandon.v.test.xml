The discussion meeting was presided over by eminent playwright and litterateur Begum Momtaz Hossain while Dr. Hayat Mahmud took the chair as chief guest . The Director of the Shishu Academy , Golam Kibria , also spoke . The programme was rounded up with a colourful musical programme in which the children of different academic courses of the academy participated . The programme included Tagore 's songs , dances , and recitation of Tagore 's poems , etc. The Director of the Shishu Academy said : ` ` Tagore has taken our conscience and our culture to its pinnacle ; so if we do not understand Tagore we would not understand our identity .

He advised the children to read the works of Tagore and to listen to Rabindra Sangeet to get inspiration for building their life and the nation . Dr. Hayat Mahmud in his speech said that in his 80 years of life this boy from Jorashankor Thakhur Bari did a lot of things - he was a novelist , a dramatist , a short story writer , a <head>lyric</head> and music composer and a painter as well . He started painting at the age of 70 and continued till his death . He painted 2,500 paintings in the last 10 years of his life .

        A boy sits sifting sand through his fingers while a giant mechanical turtle crawls across the stage . In the foreground , a woman dressed in black watches from a deck chair as a jogger in bathing trunks and men and women in summer attire move along the imaginary beach . The scene , which evokes Giorgio Armani 's childhood on the Ligurian coast in the 1940s , is the opening live tableau of the ` ` G.A. Story , ' ' a 1 1/ 2-hour saga on the life and works of Italy`s fashion champion . The fashion happening presented Wednesday evening in Florence was commissioned by Pitti Immagine Uomo to honor 25 years of the semiannual men 's wear trade fair . Put together by American theater director Robert Wilson , the show walks the viewer through a spectacle of still lifes , music , dance and fashion in a former railroad station . ` ` I wanted to do something different , to break away from my usual patterns _ and I think it worked , ' ' said Armani , who usually puts on a conventional men 's wear show in Milan . The spectacle was divided into nine parts , including the Gallery of the Gods _ eight deeply tanned , perfectly shaped silver-haired models in Armani underwear and swimsuits _ and office scenes dubbed ` ` every day dancing ' ' where men and women in Armani garb work at computers or gather around the conference table . The live tableaus were interspersed with video clips of Armani 's life and work . Most of the outfits were from previous Armani showings , but the event also included the 1997 spring-summer men 's wear collection . The new warm weather look is based on a chalk gray and white palette , with flashes of brightly colored stripes . Long open-collared shirts and tank tops are preferred to t-shirts and ties . Jackets are long , trousers classic . Except for the Greek god series , the styles are not as body conscious as the tightly stretched outfits presented by other major Italian men 's wear designers earlier this week in Milan . The Florentine <head>lyric</head> to Armani ended with a dinner party thrown by a Florence industrialist in his villa in the hills overlooking the city . Cocktails under a spreading magnolia tree was followed by a dinner on the Old World patio cooked by Guido Lenci , the same chef who prepared the state dinner for the European Union summit in Florence last month . The EU leaders were also given a preview of the ` ` G.A. Story . ' ' After the Armani gala , the fashion industry got down to business at the Pitti Uomo fair , where 551 companies from 10 countries are showing their wares on the grounds of a medieval fortress . The fair includes not only top label design but also sportswear from trekking to surf and street fashion . Each stand is artfully put together . The imaginative Fendi sisters set up their clothes around a real swimming pool and they did n't forget the iced tea . The Armani showing in Florence was a coup for Florence 's fashion industry . The city Thursday honored the inventor of Pitti Uomo , Franco Savorelli , who is also a longtime friend of the Milanese designer . In another boost for the city , the Florentine Ferragamo family , famous for its shoes and in more recent years for its clothes , announced the acquisition of the French Emanuel Ungaro fashion house . The high fashion designer will keep his label and remain president of the line , Ferragamo said . slot v0329/ tw

        Many of John Hiatt 's fans buy his albums simply because there 's a new one out . If the rest of the world requires reasons to pick up this fine , mandolin-filled disc , here are a few : the organ-powered duet with Bonnie Raitt ; the almost Otis-like ballad ` ` The River Knows Your Name ' ' ; the line ` ` Ethylene , my Ethylene , my love for you is just obscene ' ' ; the offbeat hidden track . No one mixes swamp rock , Memphis soul and country into a more appealing package than Hiatt , who is also one of popular music 's more intriguing <head>lyric</head> . ` ` Walk On ' ' is one of the better albums from a songwriter who 's been covered by people as diverse as Iggy Pop and Emmylou Harris .
